  # Be careful with the index_prefix if you want to use several Graylog2 instances in the same
  # ElasticSearch cluster (cluster.name) because the web interface will perform some searches
  # against the [index_prefix]_* wildcard. Make sure that you have entirely different index
  # prefixes to avoid overlapping namespaces.
